Thank you for your purchase!

To set up a penetrator, simply drag the one you like best into the scene and attach it to your avatar! Scale the entire prefab to adjust to your liking!

To set up an orifice, drag an orifice prefab into the scene, and attach it to your avatar. Then simply delete the gameobject inside marked "Delete me"!

The Hole orifice is for when you don't want the penetrator to clip through, it does not show beyond the point of entry. Good for body orifices.

The Ring orifice shows the penetrator past the point of entry. Good for hands or X-Rays or.. I dunno ghosts or something?
